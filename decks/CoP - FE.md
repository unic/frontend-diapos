# CoP - FE

<!--n-->There are original German parts which have been translated into English for everyone's understanding.

<!--v-->

## How did we come to have a CoP - FE circle?

### 13.02.2020 - [Tactical | GCC > Strategy](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/meetings/reports/tactical/5df39454a626a30c60724b8f?)
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

In this tactical _Marcin Borowski_ brought the tension **`Frontend solutions started to vary a lot between projects`**

<!--v-->

> Until year or two ago we had in most cases single, best choice solution that many people were familiar with - Estatico.
>
> Right now:
>
> - headless - (JSS, NextJS) - Z√ºrich Flughafen, Kanton Bern, Ceratizit, Sakuba
> - Darvin - used right now inside Drupal projects - CSS
> - Estatico v2 - latest Post for example
> - Estatico v1 - almost projects older then 2y, so quite a lot
> - rawblock - unic.com
> - one or two Angular projects in Germany - myPlansee for sure
>
> to switch between one and the other technology is not easy without really solid epxerince.
>
> I would like to figure out where is this going; how can we still manage to support old projects; if we will have soon any new cadidates to join this list; do we want to promote some of solutions more both internaly and externaly; what kind of people profiles do we need to then implement projects in each of those frameworks.

<!--v-->

The tension resulted in a new project assigned to _Marcin Borowski_ as _Technology strategist_: **[Recommended Unic Frontend Technology Stack is updated.](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/5ae726c28a5e365b9e052bd2?projectId=5e45670c6618cc7a3a2e018f)**

<!--v-->

The project must have given some results, because there was a tension from _Markus Haschka_ in a Tactical meeting from 13.08.2020 from the Strategy Circle.

<!--h-->

### 13.08.2020 - [Tactical | GCC > _Strategy_](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/meetings/reports/tactical/5f353883af11bc3935530e43?)
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<!--v-->

_Markus Haschka_ opens the tactical with a tension that has per title **`deliverable out of Marcins project`**. <!--n-->The tension resulted in 2 Projects:

<!--v-->

- **[Frontend Know How is group wide assessed](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/5ae726c28a5e365b9e052bd2?projectId=5f354259066ae40f0d70afc4)** (assigned to _Marcin Borowski_ as _Technology strategist_)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- **[A training program for identified gaps from the front-end know-how assessment has been created](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/5ae726c28a5e365b9e052bd2?projectId=5f354259066ae40f0d70afc5)** 	(assigned to _Daniel Rey_ as _RepLink_)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!--n-->So far, the RepLink should have ported this Project to a tactical in GCC üëáüèª

<!--h-->

### 24.08.2020 - [Tactical | GCC](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/meetings/reports/tactical/5f436af6340bff33d17a4159?)
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<!--v-->

Tension from _Daniel Rey_ as _RepLink_ from GCC > _Strategy_ (where the project was created): **A training program for identified gaps from the front-end know-how assessment has been created**

<!--v-->

> As a technology strategist with focus Frontend, Marcin Borowski has processed the project in the Strategy Circle "_Recommended Unic frontend technology stack is updated_". His goal was to enable Unic to focus on a few frontend technologies. However, the result was that the range of technologies used is largely justified and sensible. Primarily these are currently Estatico, Darwin, React and Angular.
>
> He primarily sees problems in the training of employees. The requirements in the frontend area have increased significantly, so now it is necessary to compensate them with a targeted training program.
>
> Since frontend experts are spread across a number of circles, the GCC is the only common denominator.
>
> From my point of view, it is either necessary to expand the responsibilities of "Unicversity Curation", or to create a partner role that is responsible for the development of training courses. I would like to have your opinion.

<!--v-->

After the feedback he gathered (that we don't know yet) he created a project and assigned it to himself individually:

[Project | Individual: Daniel Rey](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/584ebb42ab2882c82c8b456f?projectId=5f437ac1aaa5a97d5c460424): **The structure of CoP circles as part of the management system has been clarified**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!--v-->

Basically it is beeing seeked a global solution based on the tension generated in the FE community.

<!--h-->

### 31.08.2020 - [Governance | GCC > Corporate Services > Management System](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/meetings/reports/governance/5f4d07077a2bc3323e20854c?)
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<!--v-->

This was a Governance meeting scheduled with the only purpose to give answer to the Individual Project from Daniel Rey.

In the meeting, the **CoP - Fe** circle is created together with the **CoP Kubernetes**. In the tension there's a reference to the original project **A training program for identified gaps from the front-end know-how assessment has been created**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!--h-->

### 01.09.2020 - Project update: [The structure of CoP circles as part of the management system has been clarified](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/584ebb42ab2882c82c8b456f?projectId=5f437ac1aaa5a97d5c460424)
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<!--n-->One day after the creation from the circle, the Project from Daniel Rey received an update with the following text:

<!--v-->

> The tension was processed in the GCC Tactical on August 24, 2020. It turns out that such a training program is a task of the Community of Practice (CoP) frontend. However, CoP Frontend is not yet part of Unic's holocratic system. Therefore, responsibilities and budget have not been clarified. CoP 44 (Conception / UX) is a sub-circle of management system. AttaCHED as such in the holocratic system, with appropriate purpose and accountabilities. This makes CoP 44 currently one of the few working CoPs at Unic. Accordingly, we want to copy this recipe for success. Fritz von Allmen is the lead link of the management system. He feels the same tension and has implemented our proposal accordingly in the management system governance of August 31.

<!--h-->

## Takeouts after investigating how the CoP - FE was created
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<!--v-->

1. Unic recognises that

   `the range of [Frontend] technologies used is largely justified and sensible`.

<!--v-->

2. Unic recognisess that

   `The requirements in the frontend area have increased significantly`

<!--v-->

3. Unic looks at CoP 44 (Conception/UX) as a success case and **seeks repeating this success** to leverage Frontend Knowhow with the creation of this circle.

<!--n-->4. The original project that trigered this is still open and assigned to Marcin as _Technology strategist_: **[Recommended Unic Frontend Technology Stack is updated.](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/5ae726c28a5e365b9e052bd2?projectId=5e45670c6618cc7a3a2e018f)**<br /><br />
5. The 1st project from that tension remains open and assigned to Marcin as _Technology strategist_: **[Frontend Know How is group wide assessed](https://app.holaspirit.com/o/584ebb40ab2882c82c8b4568/projects/circle/5ae726c28a5e365b9e052bd2?projectId=5f354259066ae40f0d70afc4)**
